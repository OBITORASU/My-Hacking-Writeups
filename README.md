# My Collection of CTF writeups

## Description 
This is a collection of some of the interesting challenges I came accross in the multiple CTFs I participated in. Hopefully I will keep updating this with new content with every new event I attend. 

## Motivation
Documenting my progress is the clear goal and motivation behind me creating this repository and sharing my approach to problems in CTF events. This would not only help improve my note taking skills but also help me to analyse where I can improve and work on in terms of my hacking skills when I take a look back at this.


## What I provide in this repository?
I will provide links to all the tools and websites I have used while solving challenges. Additionally, I will also provide the scripts I used during the event along with screenshots to make the writeups more lively and easily understandable for anyone reading.

## Future plans?
In the future I might transform this repository into an all in one hacking repository where I will share writeups for CTF challenges as well as my reports for the boxes from TryHackMe and HackTheBox.
